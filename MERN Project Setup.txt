1. Context API:
The Context API is a built-in feature of React that allows you to share state across components without passing props manually through each level of the component tree. It provides a simple and lightweight way to manage global state.

How Context API Works:
Context: You create a context using React.createContext(), which holds a shared state.
Provider: The context has a Provider component that wraps the components needing access to the shared state. The Provider supplies the state to its children.
Consumer: Components that need to access the state use the useContext hook (in functional components) or the Context.Consumer (in class components).
